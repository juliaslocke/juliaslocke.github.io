	<h4>Some of my work</h4>
	<div id="projects">
		<div class="project" id="project1">
			<h5>UX Design Capstone Course</h5>
			<p>During this Winter 2018 semester at the University of Michigan, I am working with MySwimPro in redesigning the onboarding process of their application in order to increase the number of users subscribing to premium. After conducting user and competitor research we have now begun the design phase. Updates to come as I move along with the process.</p>

			<h5>Usability Evaluation Course</h5>
			<p>In a course at the University of Michigan, I spent a semester developing my research skill set by conducting a user experience research study on the Uber application. Below are the deliverables created and the conclusions drawn.</p>

		<div class="project" id="project3">
			<h5>Interaction Design Course</h5>
			<p>During the Fall 2017 semester at the University of Michigan, I participated in a semester long project for my Interaction Design course. I worked to find a way to engage a community of my choosing, following the CHI 2018 Student Design Challenge prompt.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project" id="project4">
			<h5>Agile Development Tools</h5>
			<p>While working as an UX Intern, I had the responsibility of designing materials to be used in assessments of Agile Development teams. The Agile Development teams were implementing a new way of assessing the satisfaction and success of each team. This involved utilizing cards that would describe different areas of concern. The requirements for these cards were that they had to clearly present all information on the card so that they could be viewed and understood from a distance. The images also had to be simple but descriptive of the main ideas of each card.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project" id="project5">
			<h5>Internal Application</h5>
			<p>While working as an UX Intern, I was part of a team that had the responsibility of brainstorming and prototyping an internal application. The application was to be used to measure employee satisfaction and capability in order to determine company productivity. The requirements were that the application had to be enjoyable for users, whether that meant quick to complete, engaging, or both, and it had to tell employees the value that would come from participation with the application.</p>
